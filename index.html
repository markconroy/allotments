      <h1>Local Authority Provided Allotments and Community Gardens in Ireland</h1>
      <p>Data collected from 31 lcoal authorities in Ireland via survey in once off climate action research. The full report is <a href="https://www.lgma.ie/en/publications/local-authority-sector-reports/a-profile-of-local-government-climate-actions-in-ireland-final.pdf">available as a pdf</a>.</p>
      <p>This data comes from <a href="https://data.gov.ie/dataset/allotments-and-community-gardens-by-local-authority">data.gov.ie</a>. I just thought it would be interesting to make it available in an easier to read format.</p>
      <p>The questions asked were:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Do you provide allotments for public use?</li>
        <li>Number of allotments for public use as of 31/12/18</li>
        <li>Do you provide community gardens for public use?</li>
        <li>Number of community gardens for public use as of 31/12/18</li>
      </ol>
